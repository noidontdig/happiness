        %h3 why?
        %p Thankfully was created by 4 NYU undergraduate students for our Science of Happiness class. We want to promote happiness and well-being by encouraging people to tweet #thankful tweets everyday. 

        %h3 what?
        %p Thankfully saves users' #thankful tweets and provides them with analytics, so that they can take note of what they are thankful for, and through that, enhance their happiness. Help us spread #thankful tweets around the world!
